# Classes

We have 3 classes as part of the retirement contract:
- `retirement.hpp` contains the smart contract actions
- `authority.hpp` contains the birth certificate authority required to execute the reminder action
- `reminder.hpp` contains the table of reminders for activating citizen's pensions
