# Folder structure

Go to the `build` folder for compiling the code
Go to the `tests` folder to see examples of each of the tests in the system
Go to the `include` and `src` folders to see the smart contract, tables, and mock systems that were set up
Check out the `CMakeLists.txt` file in this folder and in the `src` folder to see how I set up local versions of the contract for testing purposes and how to create mock and test actions
